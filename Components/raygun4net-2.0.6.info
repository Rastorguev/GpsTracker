{"Name":"Raygun4Net","Id":763,"Alias":"raygun4net","Description":"Raygun4Net is a small library that can listen to all unhandled exceptions in your Android and iOS applications and send the details to your [Raygun.io](http://raygun.io/) account. This allows you to see issues in your application as soon as your users find them. Then you can debug and release a new bug-free version faster than ever before.\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, there is not much code required at all to integrate this Raygun provider into your application. Full documentation is provided when you install this component, and a step-by-step guide is available when you register an application on your [Raygun.io](http://raygun.io/) dashboard.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Mindscape.Raygun4Net;\r\n...\r\n\r\n// Place this code somewhere in the main entry point of your application.\r\nRaygunClient.Attach(\"YOUR_APP_API_KEY\");\r\n```\r\n","Version":"2.0.6","Summary":"Send exception messages in your Android and iOS applications to the Raygun.io cloud service.","QuickStart":"Usage\r\n====================\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\nTo send all unhandled exceptions in your application, use the static RaygunClient.Attach method using your app API key. The best place to put this is in the main/entry Activity of your application.\r\nThere is also an overload for the Attach method that lets you pass in a user-identity string which is useful for tracking affected users in your Raygun.io dashboard.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nRaygunClient.Attach(\"YOUR_APP_API_KEY\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### iOS\r\n\r\nIn the main entry point of the application, use the static RaygunClient.Attach method using your app API key. This will send all unhandled exceptions in your application.\r\nThere is also an overload for the Attach method that lets you pass in a user-identity string which is useful for tracking affected users in your Raygun.io dashboard.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nstatic void Main (string[] args)\r\n{\r\n  RaygunClient.Attach(\"YOUR_APP_API_KEY\");\r\n\r\n  UIApplication.Main (args, null, \"AppDelegate\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Android \u0026 IOS\r\n\r\nAt any point after calling the Attach method, you can use RaygunClient.SharedClient to get the static instance. This can be used for manually sending messages or changing options such as the User identity string. There are various overloads for the Send method that allow you to optionally send tags, custom data and an alternate version number.\r\n\r\nWhere is my app API key?\r\n====================\r\n\r\nWhen sending exceptions to the Raygun.io service, an app API key is required to map the messages to your application.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a new application on your Raygun.io dashboard, your app API key is displayed at the top of the instructions page. You can also find the API key by clicking the \"Application Settings\" button in the side bar of the Raygun.io dashboard.\r\n\r\nSamples\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBecause of the API key requirement mentioned above, in order to run the samples you\u0027ll need to replace YOUR_APP_API_KEY in MainActivity (for Android) and Main.cs (for iOS) to be an api key you\u0027ve generated in your Raygun.io dashboard.\r\n\r\nNamespace\r\n====================\r\nThe main classes can be found in the Mindscape.Raygun4Net namespace.\r\n","Hash":"7abe9c6c2dbbe8210d737067671d0c07","TargetPlatforms":["ios","android"],"TrialHash":null}
